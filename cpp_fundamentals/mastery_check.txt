1.  It has been said that c++ sits at the center of the modern programming universe.
    Explain this statement
    C++ sits one level above C and one level below Java and C#. Therefore C++ has 
    object oriented programing like the higher level languages do but also has the
    speed of C since it is a subset of it a compiles into machine code that the
    computer needs no translation to use

2.  A C++ compiler produces object code that is directly excecuted by the computer.
    True or false?
    True

3. What are the three main principles of object-oriented programming? STUDY 
    Encapsulation
    I
    P

    The three main principles of object-oriented programming are:

    Encapsulation - bundling data and methods together
    Inheritance - allows classes to derive properties from other classes
    Polymorphism - enables using objects of different types through a common interface


4. Where do C++ programs begin excecution?
    main()

5.  What is a header? STUDY
    header is a set of functions that can be used by the program

    A header in C++ is a file that contains declarations for functions, classes, 
    and objects that can be used in your program. Headers often provide access to 
    standard libraries or reusable code. For example, <iostream> is a header that 
    allows you to use input and output streams like cin and cout.

6.  What is <iostream>? what does the following code do?
    #include <iostream>
    <iostream> is a header used to handle C++'s input and output. The following code
    allows the user to call functions defined by the iostream library

    <iostream> is a standard C++ header file that provides input and output stream 
    objects, such as cin for input and cout for output. The code #include <iostream> 
    allows your program to use these input/output features, enabling you to read from 
    the keyboard and write to the screen.

7.  What is a namespace? STUDY
    namespace is 

    A namespace in C++ is a way to organize code and prevent naming conflicts by 
    grouping related identifiers (such as variables, functions, and classes) under 
    a unique name. For example, the std namespace contains all the standard C++ library 
    features like cout and cin. Using namespace std; lets you use these features without 
    prefixing them with std::.

8.  What is a variable?
    a variable is a memory space that can be assigned a value

9.  Which of the following variable names is/are invalid?
    A. count
    B. _count
    C. count27
    D. 67count invalid
    E. if invalid

10. How do you create a single-line comment? How do you create a multiline comment?
    single-line //
    multiline /* */

11. Show the general form of the if statement. Show the general form of the for loop. STUDY
    if (condition){}
    for (initialization;condition;increment){}

12. How do you create a block of code?
    {}

13. The moon's gravity is about 17 percent that of Earth's. Write a program that displays a
    table that shows Earth pounds and their equivalent moon weight. Have the table run from 
    1 to a 100 pounds. Output a newline every 25 pounds.

14. A year on Jupiter (the time it takes for Jupiter to make one full circuit around the Sun) takes
    about 12 Earth years. Write a program that converts Jovian years to Earth years. Have the
    user specify the number of Jovian years. Allow fractional years.

15. When a function is called, what happens to program control?
    program will jump to where the function was created. Essentially will excecute the code
    statemnts in the function and then jump back to where the function was called to continue
    from top to bottom.

16. Write a program that averages the absolute value of five values entered by the user. Display
    the result.
