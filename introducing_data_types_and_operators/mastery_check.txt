1.  What type of intigers are supported by C++?

    short, long, signed and unsigned

2.  By default, what type is 12.2?

    double

3.  What values can a bool variable have?

    true or false (1 or 0)

4.  What is the long intiger data type?

    The long intiger data type is at minimum 

5.  What escape sequence produces a tab? What escape sequence rings the bell?

    \t, no idea

6.  A string is surrounded by the double quotes. True or false?

    True

7.  What are the hexadecimal digits?

    0x followed by number. They use base 16 instead of 10.

8.  Show the general form for intializing a variable when it is declared?

    type name = value;

9.  What does the % do? Can it be used on floting-point values?

    Modulo opertor is used to get the remained from an intiger value. No

10. Explain the difference between the prefix and postfix forms of the increment operator.

    Prefix will do the increment first then assign. Postfix will assign first then increment.

    For example
    int x, y = 10;
    
    x = ++y; // x gets assigned 11

    y = 10;

    x = y++; // x gets assigned 10

    // in both cases y value is increaed to 11 nevertheless.

11. Which of the following are logical operators in C++?
    A. && Y
    B. ## N
    C. || Y
    D. $$ N
    E. !  Y

12. How can 
    x = x + 12;
    be rewritten?

    x += 12;

13. What is a cast?

  a cast is a conversion from one type to another.

14. Write a program that finds all the prime numbers between 1 and 100.
